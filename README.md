#Speedy A/B testing with an Edge App + Google Analytics

The Edge is a *great* place to solve certain categories of problems. For example: A/B testing - comparing multiple versions of a web page to see which one performs better.

A/B testing is backed by real data from real users. It gives you a clear solution on which app changes/optimizations you should implement to help grow your business. You can test areas such as session duration, bounce rate, conversions and more. Proper A/B testing can lead to: better resonance with your audience, boosted conversion rates and increased ROI.

The idea is that you take a subset of your users (or 100%) and break them up into randomly assigned groups. Each one of these groups simultaneously sees a slightly different version of your app during the testing period (usually at least 7 days). Then you can observe how each group interacts with each variant. From there, you can make an informed decision about which variation proves most effective for your business goals. 

 

We think it’s important for you to be able to easily get started with an A/B test, assess your results and help you understand if the results you’re seeing are truly meaningful. So, we built an example using an Edge app + Google Analytics to help you do just that.
